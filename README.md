# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard â€“ Excel Project
## Project Objective:
This project focuses on analyzing road accident data to identify key patterns and insights that can contribute to improving road safety. By exploring various factors such as time, location, vehicle types, and accident severity, the goal is to uncover trends and correlations that highlight the causes of road accidents. The analysis is performed using Python with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to clean, process, and visualize the data effectively.
## Dataset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/supri224/Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/Road%20accident%20analysis%20data.xlsb">Dataset</a>

## Questions(KPIs)
- What is the total number of casualties reported?
- What is the distribution of casualty severities (Fatal, Serious, Slight)?
- What percentage of accidents were fatal
- What year-over-year trend is visible in total casualties (if time series exists)?
- What is the fatality rate among all reported accidents?
- What percentage of accidents resulted in serious injuries?
- What is the ratio of slight to serious injuries?
- How does the distribution of fatal/severe/slight accidents compare across different groups (e.g., region, vehicle type, time)?
- Are there outliers in regions with unusually high fatality proportions?
- Dashboard interaction <a href="https://github.com/supri224/Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/Road%20Accident%20Analysis%20Dashboard.png"> view dashboard</a>
